# Email Classification & PII Processing System for IT Support Automation

## Introduction
This API classifies support emails into four ITIL categories (Incident, Request, Problem, Change) using a fine-tuned DeBERTa model. The service automatically masks personally identifiable information (PII) before processing, ensuring privacy compliance.

## Features
- **Automatic Classification**: Fast categorization of support emails
- **PII Protection**: Automatic masking of sensitive information
- **ITIL Alignment**: Categories map to standard ITIL service management framework
- **High Accuracy**: Based on state-of-the-art DeBERTa language model
- **Easy Integration**: Simple REST API interface

## Hardware Requirements
* **For Development/Testing:**
   * CPU: 2+ cores
   * RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)
   * Storage: 1GB free space
* **For Production Deployment:**
   * CPU: 4+ cores
   * RAM: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended for higher throughput)
   * GPU: Optional but beneficial for faster inference

## Software Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* Flask
* PyTorch
* Transformers library
* PII masking utilities
